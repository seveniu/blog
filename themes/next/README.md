# NexT For Hugo

A Hugo theme forked from [NexT](https://github.com/iissnan/hexo-theme-next).

## Discription

NexT is a simple and animated theme. I transplanted it from Hexo to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and used in my blog site.

[Preview online](http://www.lanlingzi.cn)

## Usage

1. git clone https://github.com/xtfly/hugo-theme-next.git next

2. copy next directory to theme directory in your hugo site

3. move config.toml to the root dir in your hugo site, and modify it to the actual information for your site.


## Notes

- **Some of the Hexo's styles are not work now** because of the difference between the Hugo template engine and the Hexo. I will update it constantly

- This theme has been tested only in my blog site. Maybe it's not suitable for your requirements, you can customizate it by your preferences.

- Test in Hugo verion: 0.25
